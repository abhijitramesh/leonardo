# Style Transfer
Style transfer is a technique in which two images are take an object image and a style image, the style image is usually a painting which has properties like colour, saturation, specific strides etc.. the object image is which has the object to which we need to apply this style. The neural network learns from the style image the properties and applies it to the object image to give an output image which has the style of the style image but the object that we provided.

One of the most significate application is Google's Deep dream project.
